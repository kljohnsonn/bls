# bls: (better) ls


######  A messy and basic implementation of ls.

### Usage

Simply clone the repo and run the Makefile, then navigate to the bin folder and do ```make install`` and you can use it globally. Output currently isn't formatted. I'll fix that soon. Goal is to get familiar with C programming language. This project will go no where.
